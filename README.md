# Nozzle-Flow
A  nozzle geometry designed for Mach 2 was considered and an iterative program based on MacCormackâ€™s method was developed to determine the flow field variables by solving the Euler equations modified for a quasi 1D flow. The isentropic, supersonic case and a subsonic case were tested against analytic results. The supersonic case was found to be in good agreement with analytic results and largely insensitive to initial conditions and was found to converge within 5000 iterations for a 50-cell grid. The subsonic case was found to converge to the analytic solution only for specific cases.
